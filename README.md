# Linear-Regression---Bike-Sharing-Assignment
BoomBikes wants to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around, stand out from other service providers, and make profits.
The company wants to assess:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes
- How well the identified variables can describe the bike demands
